🩺 Breast Cancer Detector
Breast Cancer Detector is a simple yet powerful machine learning web app that helps predict whether a tumor is Malignant or Benign based on user-provided medical features. Built for educational purposes, it's an ideal starter project for beginners learning AI/ML and Streamlit.

🧠 What It Does
Takes input for features like radius, texture, area, and smoothness.

Uses a trained ML model to predict tumor type.

Displays prediction with a confidence score.

Shows an interactive probability gauge chart for easy understanding.
